### Final Diagnosis:

Here are three possible health issues of the patient, along with the reasons for each:

1. **Atypical Angina or Cardiac Ischemia**  
   - **Reason**: The cardiologist noted that the patient's epigastric pain could be a referred symptom of cardiac ischemia, especially given her sedentary lifestyle and occasional smoking (a cardiovascular risk factor). Atypical presentations are common in women, and further cardiac testing (e.g., stress test) is recommended to rule this out.

2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Exacerbating Gastrointestinal Symptoms**  
   - **Reason**: The psychologist highlighted the patient's history of GAD, which can worsen gastrointestinal issues like IBS and gastritis through the gut-brain axis. Stress and anxiety may amplify her epigastric pain and nausea, suggesting a psychosomatic component.

3. **Smoking-Related Respiratory Irritation or Early COPD**  
   - **Reason**: The pulmonologist identified the patient's occasional smoking as a risk for airway irritation, chronic bronchitis, or early COPD. Even light smoking can contribute to respiratory symptoms over time, warranting spirometry and smoking cessation counseling.  

These issues reflect a combination of cardiac, psychological, and pulmonary factors contributing to the patient's symptoms.

### Final Diagnosis:

- Panic disorder with hyperventilation/dysfunctional breathing
  - Reason: Abrupt 10–20 minute episodes of palpitations, chest tightness, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and “impending doom” with a normal cardiac workup; history of anxiety; pulmonology notes panic-related hyperventilation/dysfunctional breathing.

- Intermittent cardiac arrhythmia (paroxysmal SVT or symptomatic ectopy; brief AF less likely but possible)
  - Reason: Palpitations/skipped beats with occasional PVCs documented; a 24-hour Holter can miss brief paroxysms; cardiology recommends extended ambulatory monitoring and consumer ECG capture; symptoms may be provoked by stress/caffeine or posture (IST/POTS also considered).

- GERD with esophageal spasm and reflux-related laryngeal/bronchospasm
  - Reason: GERD/esophageal spasm can mimic angina and trigger chest tightness/dyspnea; pulmonology notes reflux-induced laryngospasm/bronchospasm; plans include optimized PPI timing, possible BID trial, alginate, and ENT evaluation for laryngopharyngeal reflux/inducible laryngeal obstruction.
